Giovanni

=head1 VERSION

version 1.12

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Giovanni is a Perl replacement for the idea behind Capistrano. It is a
deployment system that can be used comfortably from the commandline to
check out code, restart systems and notify.
The system is currently used with git and manages some Catalyst and
Mojolicious apps and notifies via Jabber. It supports timestamped
rollouts (ie have the last 5 versions of your code on the server and link
to the currently running one) and plain git repositories. It tries to
detect problems in the deployment process and rolls back. It supports
manual rollbacks, two restart modes and does all that without any code
on the server. All you need is a working ssh setup with ssh-keys that
handle the login. 
We also use it with Jenkins to automatically deploy
code that successfully completed the test suite.

Giovanni comes with a commandline tool called gio. Check the gio manpage
for the config file format.
